last.fm Streamgraph
-------------------

Inspired by [LastGraph](http://lastgraph.aeracode.org/).

## TODO

* Click on stream to isolate it from the rest
* Make the slider more intuitive
* Find a way to optimize SVG performance

## Ideas

* Make user's registration date earliest possible date to select
* Make current date latest possible date to select
* Split data into weekly segments and draw only those segments covered by slider
