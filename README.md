last.fm Streamgraph
-------------------

Visualise your last.fm listening history in the form of a streamgraph.

Inspired by [LastGraph](http://lastgraph.aeracode.org/), but maybe not as good just yet. [Give it a try](http://dstrekelj.github.io/last.fm-streamgraph).

## TODO

* Make the slider more intuitive
* Find a way to optimize SVG performance (should actually use canvas instead)

## Ideas

* Make user's registration date earliest possible date to select
* Make current date latest possible date to select
* Split data into weekly segments and draw only those segments covered by slider (possible SVG performance increase?)
* Add vertical line as mouse position indicator on axis
* Show daily playcount for mouseover-ed / clicked artist
